# developing
A set of materials useful when learning to develop software. The software (and hardware) landscape is wide


# the command line and other tools
You will spend a lot of time here. So it is worth getting familiar and comfortable with a prompt. You dont need to be a master, just not scared.


# other concepts worth knowing about
To build software you will be travelling around many computers. Networks and connectivity play a larger part than previously. File systems are everywhere.

> ssh, certificates and keys, encryption, file systems, others...


# source control
You will definitely want to control the source.

# building your source
Once your source is controlled it may need building.

> maven, gradle, other...


# pipelines and CI/CD
How do we demonstrate the quality or what we produce and how do we control its flow towards the LIVE systems.

> jenkins and other pipeline tools, quality checks, other...


# environments and hosting
Your software will want to run somewhere. And not only on your local machine.

> docker, ansible, AWS (there are other clouds), other...


# software design principles
What makes great (read working to expected design and maintainable) software?
Whatever the language or framework, there are some guiding principles that will make your software shine.

> small, single responsibility, abstractions, DI, low dependencies - all driven by testability


# your first language
A short while back I would have said go for Java. It has stood the test of time. 20+ years and is still in wide use. But I am unsure about its suitablility for learning and maybe its time for one of the young(er) guns to take over.

> Go, javascript, typescript, other...
